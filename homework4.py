#1 Write a program that takes two integers as input and prints the larger of the two.
# num1 = input(' nubmer 1:')
# num2 = input(' number 2:')
# num1 = int(num1)
# num2 = int(num2)

# if num1 > num2:
#     print(num1, 'is larger')
# if num2 > num1:
#     print(num2, 'is larger')



#2 Write a program that takes a string as input and prints the length of the string if it is greater than 10, and "Length less than or equal to 10" 

# phrases = input(' type your word:')
# max = 10
# if len(phrases) > max:
#     print(phrases,'is',len(phrases))
# if len(phrases) < max:
#     print(phrases,'is',len(phrases))
# if len(phrases) == max:
#     print(phrases,'is',len(phrases))



#3 Write a program that takes an integer as input and prints "Even" if the integer is even and "Odd" if it is odd.
# usr_input = int(input('tybe your number:'))
# if (usr_input % 2) == 0:
#     print('even')
# else:
#     print('odd')
# print(8%2)
# print(9%2)

#4 Write a program that takes an integer as input and prints "Positive" if it is positive, "Negative" if it is negative, and "Zero" if it is zero.

#5 Write a program that takes a string as input and checks if it starts with the letter "A". If it does, print "Starts with A", otherwise print "Does not start with A".

#6 Write a program that takes two strings as input and prints "Equal" if they are equal, and "Not equal" otherwise.

#7 Write a program that takes a string as input and prints "Uppercase" if all the letters in the string are uppercase, and "Not uppercase" otherwise.


user_input = input('type your  word:')

if user_input.startswith('A'):
    print('Start with A')
else:
    print('Does not start with A')

# x= 'food'
# print(x[3])
# print(x[2])
# print(x[-1])

strin1= input()
strin2= input()
